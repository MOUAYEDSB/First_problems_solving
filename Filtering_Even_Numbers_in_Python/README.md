# Test Question: Filtering Even Numbers in Python ðŸ”¥
In this problem-solving test, you will be writing a Python function to filter even numbers from a list of integers. Your goal is to create a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers.

Requirements:

Implement a function called filter_even_numbers that takes a single argument: a list of integers.
The function should return a new list containing only the even numbers from the input list.
Do not modify the original list; create a new list to store the even numbers.
Instructions:

Start by defining the filter_even_numbers function.
Inside the function, create an empty list to store the even numbers.
Iterate through each element in the input list using a loop.
Check if the element is even (i.e., divisible by 2). If it is, append it to the new list.
After processing all elements, return the new list containing only the even numbers.
Note: Ensure that the function works correctly for different inputs, including lists of various lengths and containing both even and odd numbers.

Example:

python
Copy code
input_list = [3, 8, 12, 7, 4, 6, 9, 10]
even_numbers = filter_even_numbers(input_list)
print(even_numbers) 

Output: [8, 12, 4, 6, 10]
